1) Click on [armada_client](https://pypi.org/project/armada-client/).
2) Read the file [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
3) Click [here](https://armadaproject.io/libraries) get an overview of Armada client libraries

Python client wrapping the gRPC services defined in `submit.proto` and `events.proto`; allows for

- submitting, cancelling, and re-prioritising jobs, and
- watching for job events.


## Build
Prerequisites:

For building the python client:
In the repo level, run `make python` then `cd client/python` and lastly run `pip install .` to install the client from git with all necessary dependencies.

1) pyenv
   - Sets up local python environment for supporting multiple python environments
   - Set up a local python 3.9 environment
2) pip
   - Package is defined by pyproject.toml
   - `pip install .` will pull dependencies and install based on pyproject.toml
3) tox
   - `tox -e format` will check formatting/linter for your code according to default black settings and flake8
   - `tox -e py39` will run unit tests with your default python 3.9 environment
4) Auto formatting
   - `tox -e format-code` will run black formatter on client and testing code.
## CI

We use tox for running our formatting and testing jobs in github actions.

## Testing
gRPC requires a server to start so our unit tests are not true unit tests.  We start a grpc server and then our unit tests run against that server.

`poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_client.py`

This is just a simple test that starts a grpc server in the background and verifies that we can call the client.

## Releasing

This is to be automated.

Manual Release:

Log into the Armada-GROSS account on PyPI.
Generate the API tokens and copy those tokens to ~/.pypirc.
`poetry build`
`poetry run twine upload dist/*`
