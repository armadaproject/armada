Armada is an application to achieve high throughput of run-to-completion jobs on multiple Kubernetes clusters.

It stores queues for users/projects with pod specifications and creates these pods once there is available resource in one of the connected Kubernetes clusters.

## Key features
- Armada maintains fair resource share over time (inspired by HTCondor priority)
- It can handle large amounts of queued jobs (million+)
- It allows adding and removing clusters from the system without disruption
- By utilizing multiple Kubernetes clusters the system can scale beyond the limits of a single Kubernetes cluster

## Key concepts

**Queue:** Represents a user or project, used to maintain fair share over time, with a priority factor

**Job:** Unit of work to be run (described as a Kubernetes PodSpec)

**Job Set:** Group of related jobs. The API allows observing progress of a job set together
