// Armada state transition model
//
// The central concepts are:
// - Jobs (i.e., a request for Armada to run a particular application).
//   Each job consists of a set of Kubernetes resources (e.g., one or more pod specs, a service, and an ingress).
//   One resource is labeled the main resource, and the job is considered to have finished when that resource exits.
//   Each job is part of exactly one job set.
// - Job sets (i.e., a set of jobs that can be controlled and monitored as a unit).
//   Each job set has a unique user-supplied name, which is namespaced by queue.
//   Job sets are implicit in the sense that they consist of all jobs submitted with the same job set name.
// - Job runs (i.e., an attempt by Armada to run a particular job).
//   There may be several job runs associated with each job, representing multiple attempts to run the job.
//
// This is the sequence of operations associated with running a set of jobs in Armada:
// 1. Submit a job, which is composed of a set of Kubernetes resources. The request must include a job set name.
//    Armada returns a job id. Repeat this step to run multiple jobs in the same set.
// 2. Each job is added to Armada's queue. For each job, once it reaches the front of the queue
//    it is leased to an executor (of which there may be many), which is responsible for running the job
//    in a Kubernetes cluster. Executors map one-to-one to Kubernetes clusters.
// 3. The executor attempts to run the job. Each such attempt is referred to as a job run.
//    There may be several job runs associated with a job (e.g., if a run failed).
// 4. Armada will report the exit status of each job as they finish.
//
// The state transition model of each job is:
// [pending <=> leased => succeeded, failed]
//
// The state transition rules for each job are:
// - After being submitted, the job is pending until it has been leased to an executor by the scheduler.
// - The job transitions to the failed state if it cannot be leased to an executor
//   (e.g., if the job requests more resources than what is available in any cluster).
// - The job is in the leased state while it is leased to at least one executor.
// - The job transitions from leased to succeeded if all runs have finished and at least one succeeded
//   (i.e., the application exited with a zero exit code).
// - The job transitions from leased to pending if all runs failed and the error is considered recoverable
//   (e.g., if the pod was preempted).
// - The job transitions from leased to failed if all runs failed and the error is considered non-recoverable
 //  (e.g., if the the application exited with a non-zero exit code).
//
// The state transition model of each job run is:
// [pending => assigned => running => succeeded, failed]
//
// The state transition rules for each job run are:
// - Each job run starts when the job is assigned to an executor (by the scheduler),
//   at which point it is in the pending state.
// - While in the pending state, the executor attempts to assign the job to a node,
//   at which point the run transitions to the assigned state.
// - The run transitions to the running state once the application is running on the node it was assigned to.
// - From the running state, the run transitions to either the succeeded or failed state
//   (depending on the application exit code).
// - The run may transition to the failed state from any of the other states
//   (e.g., due to a lease expiry or due to being preempted).

// Message representing a sequence of state transitions.
// This is the only message type that should ever be published to the log.
