# Private Vulnerability Reporting

This project appreciates and encourages coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities. We prefer that you use the
GitHub reporting mechanism to privately report vulnerabilities. Under the main repository's Security tab,
click "*Report a vulnerability*" to open
the [advisory form](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/security/advisories/new).

If you are unable to report it via GitHub, have received no response after repeated attempts, or have other security
related questions, please contact [security@gr-oss.io](mailto:security@gr-oss.io) and mention Armada in the subject.
