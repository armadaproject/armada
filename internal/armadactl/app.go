/*
Package armadactl contains all the business logic for armadactl.
It has no dependency on either viper or cobra libraries, and can be unit tested.

Output writer for the App is configurable so that tests can easily capture
and perform assertions on it. Params are initialised in the param package,
so that this package can be clear of viper dependency.

# TODO there should be a type that uniquely represents a job, instead of having to pass around several parameters

TODO add methods for querying more detailed info about queues and jobs (current priority and so on)
