# Contributing

We want everyone to feel that they can contribute to the Armada Project.  Whether you have an idea to share, an issue to report, or a pull-request of the finest, most scintillating code ever, we want you to participate!

In the sections below, you'll find some easy way to connect with other Armada developers as well as some useful informational links on our license and community policies.

Looking forward to building Armada with you!
