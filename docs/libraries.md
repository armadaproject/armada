# Libraries 

## Overview
Client libraries for Armada are under active development. This document is intended to document what clients exist and how to use them.

## Python
Armada provides python client bindings providing access to the RPC API. 

### Installation
Prerequisites for installation include a working Python installation and poetry. You may wish to install the client into a virutalenv.

Our python client bindings can be installed directly from the Armada repository.
 1. Checkout the [armada git repository](https://github.com/g-research/armada)
 2. From the root of the repository, run `make python` to generated needed gRPC code.
 3. Install the client with poetry: `cd client/python && poetry install -v` 

### Usage
Once installed, the client can be imported with `import armada_client.client`.

### API Documentation
For full documentation of our python module API, please see our [autogenerated python API docs](/python_armada_client)

### Development
Information relevant to developers working to improve the python client can be
found in the [python client readme](https://github.com/G-Research/armada/blob/master/client/python/README.md).

## C#
Armada provides C# client bindings.

This client can be accessed in the [Armada git repository](https://github.com/G-Research/armada/tree/master/client/DotNet).
