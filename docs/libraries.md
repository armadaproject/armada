## Overview
This document is an overview of Armada client libraries.

## Python
Here, we give an overview of the Armada Python client.

Prerequisites for installation include a working Python installation and poetry. You may wish to install the client into a virutalenv.

Our python client bindings can be installed directly from the Armada repository.
 1. Checkout the [armada git repository](https://github.com/g-research/armada)
 2. From the root of the repository, run `make python` to generated needed gRPC code.
 3. Install the client with poetry: `cd client/python && poetry install -v` 

### Usage
Once installed, the client can be imported with `import armada_client.client`.

### API Documentation
For full documentation of our python module API, please see our [autogenerated python API docs](/python_armada_client)

### Development
Information relevant to developers working to improve the python client can be
found in the [python client readme](https://github.com/G-Research/armada/blob/master/client/python/README.md).
