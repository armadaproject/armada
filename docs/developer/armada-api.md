Armada exposes an API via [Google Remote Procedure Call(gRPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC) or REST.

The Armada API enables remote clients (any system that has network connectivity to the Armada cluster) to run the usual Armada workflows. For example, creating or querying queues, submitting new Armada jobs, querying job status and cancelling jobs.

The two most used clients are:

* the Lookout web UI for Armada (for monitoring job progress and results)
* the armadactl ("armada control") command-line tool for creating queues, job submission, prioritisation, watching, cancellation and so on

## gRPC methods

The Armada API is defined in the `/pkg/api` folder, with `*.proto` files as the source for all generated code. 

The `/pkg/api` folder also contains generated clients, and together with helper methods from `/pkg/client`, enables you to call the Armada API from go code. For examples, [see the armadactl code](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/blob/master/cmd/armadactl/cmd/submit.go).

The following API subset defined in `/pkg/api` is intended for public use.

### `api.Submit`
 
* `/api.Submit/SubmitJobs` - submit jobs to be run
* `/api.Submit/CancelJobs` - cancel jobs
* `/api.Submit/CreateQueue` - create a new queue
* `/api.Submit/UpdateQueue` - update an existing queue
* `/api.Submit/DeleteQueue` - remove queue
* `/api.Submit/GetQueue` - get information about queue (name, permissions)
* `/api.Submit/GetQueueInfo` - get information about queued (active jobs, including those currently running)

[Read the `api.Submit` definition](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/blob/master/pkg/api/submit.proto).

### `api.Event`

* `/api.Event/GetJobSetEvents` - read events of jobs running under a particular `JobSet`

[Read the `api.Event` definition](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/blob/master/pkg/api/event.proto).

### Internal-only methods

There are additional API methods defined in `proto` specifications, which are used by Armada executor and not intended to be used by external users. This API can change in any version.

* [`event.proto`](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/blob/master/pkg/api/event.proto) - methods for event reporting
* [`queue.proto`](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/blob/master/pkg/api/queue.proto) - methods related to job leasing by executor

## REST API

The REST API only exposes the public part of the gRPC API and it is implemented using [`grpc-gateway`](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway).

[Swagger JSON specification](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/blob/master/pkg/api/api.swagger.json) is also served by Armada under `my.armada.deployment/api/swagger.json`.

## Authentication

Both gRPC and REST API support the same set of authentication methods. In the case of gRPC, all authentication methods use an `authorization` key in gRPC metadata. The REST API uses a standard HTTP authorisation header (which is translated by `grpc-gateway` to `authorization` metadata).

To set up different server authentication schemes, [see the Helm chart documentation](https://armadaproject.io/armada_helm_charts#Authentication).

### No authentication

For testing, Armada can be configured to accept no authentication. In this case, all operations use an `anonymous` user.

### OpenID Authentication

When the server is configured with OpenID, the Armada API accepts the authorisation header or metadata in the form `Bearer {oauth_token}`.

### Basic Authentication

For basic authentication, the Armada API accepts the standard authorisation header or metadata in the form `basic {base64(user:password)}`.

### Kerberos authentication

For Kerberos authentication, the Armada API accepts the same authorisation metadata for gRPC as standard Kerberos HTTP [SPNEGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPNEGO) authorisation headers. The API responds with a `WWW-Authenticate` header or metadata.

## Permissions

Armada will determine which actions you are able to perform, based on your user's permissions.
These are defined as global or on a per-queue basis.

### Global permissions

* `submit_any_jobs`
* `create_queue`
* `delete_queue`
* `cancel_any_jobs`
* `reprioritize_any_jobs`
* `watch_all_events`

[Learn more about global Armada permissions](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/blob/master/internal/server/permissions/permissions.go).

### Queue-specific permissions

The following queue-specific permission verbs control what actions can be taken per individual queues:

* `submit`
* `cancel`
* `reprioritize`
* `watch`

[Learn more about permission verbs](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/blob/master/pkg/client/queue/permission_verb.go).

### User permissions

The following table shows which permissions are required for a user to access each API endpoint (either directly or via a group).
Note that queue-specific permission require a user to be bound to a global permission as well (shown as tuples in the table).

| Endpoint           | Global Permissions      | Queue Permissions |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| `SubmitJobs`       | `submit_any_jobs`       | `submit`          |
| `CancelJobs`       | `cancel_any_jobs`       | `cancel`          |
| `ReprioritizeJobs` | `reprioritize_any_jobs` | `reprioritize`    |
| `CreateQueue`      | `create_queue`          |                   |
| `UpdateQueue`      | `create_queue`          |                   |
| `DeleteQueue`      | `delete_queue`          |                   |
| `GetQueue`         |                         |                   |
| `GetQueueInfo`     | `watch_all_events`      | `watch`           |
| `GetJobSetEvents`  | `watch_all_events`      | `watch`           |
