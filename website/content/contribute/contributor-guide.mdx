## Local Development Setup

To setup your development environment, follow the instructions based on the area you want to contribute to:

- **For Armada core development**: See the [Developer Guide](../developer-guide.mdx) for local setup, code structure, and development workflows
- **For Armada Operator development**: See the [Armada Operator repository](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada-operator) for setup instructions and development guidelines

## Reporting Issues

If you spot a bug or have a feature request, please raise an issue in our main GitHub project:

- [https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/issues](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/issues)

## Finding Issues to Work On

New to the project? Check out issues tagged with ["good first issue"](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/labels/good%20first%20issue). These are curated for newcomers to get familiar with the codebase.

## Submitting Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request, make sure to follow these guidelines:

### Link to an issue

Make sure your PR references a related [issue](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/issues)

### Use a separate branch

Keep all pull requests on a separate branch with a proper name

### Follow branch naming

Branch names must follow Docker naming conventions (valid ASCII, lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, underscores, periods, and dashes; no leading period or dash; max 128 characters)

### Squash small commits

Squash fix-up commits to keep the repository clean ([guide](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/autosquashing-git-commits))

### Signing Off Commits (DCO)

All commits must be signed off using the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). This certifies that you have the right to submit your work under the project's open source license.

> **Every commit in your PRs must have a "Signed-off-by" attribute.**

Use the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m 'Your commit message'
```

The `Author` and `Signed-off-by` lines must match. If they don't, the PR will be rejected by the automated DCO check.

If you forgot to sign off and haven't pushed yet, amend your commit:

```bash
git commit --amend -s
```

For more details, see [DCO](https://github.com/apps/dco).
