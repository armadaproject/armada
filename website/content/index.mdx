title: '[TMP] Armada Documentation - Table of Contents'
---

> [!NOTE]
> This page outlines a proposed structure for Armada's documentation website, designed to support three primary user journeys from initial discovery through advanced usage and contribution.
>
> **Purpose**: Establish a coherent structure and content framework to guide documentation development and ensure comprehensive coverage of user needs across different experience levels.
>
> **Target Audiences:**
>
> - **Users**: Data scientists, engineers, and analysts who submit and manage computational jobs
> - **Operators**: Infrastructure teams responsible for deploying, scaling, and maintaining Armada clusters
> - **Developers**: Developers building integrations, extending core functionality, or contributing to the open-source project
>
> **Next Steps**: This structure will evolve based on community feedback and real-world usage patterns. Maintainers and contributors are encouraged to share insights on content gaps, user pain points, and structural improvements.
