The easiest way to install **Armada** is by using the **Armada Operator**, a Kubernetes operator that manages the lifecycle of **Armada components**.

The operator is available in the [Armada Operator repository](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada-operator).

Follow the [Quickstart](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada-operator?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart) to create your first Armada cluster.
