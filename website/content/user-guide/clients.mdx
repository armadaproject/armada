## Overview

Armada provides official client libraries for multiple programming languages, making it easy to integrate Armada into your applications. These libraries wrap the Armada gRPC APIs and provide type-safe, idiomatic interfaces for your preferred language.

All client libraries support the core Armada features:

- Submitting, canceling, and reprioritizing jobs
- Watching for job events
- Managing queues
- Stream processing and real-time updates

## Python Client

The Python client is the most mature and feature-rich client library. It's available on PyPI and can be installed with:

```bash
pip install armada-client
```

### Requirements

- **Python 3.9+** - Required Python version

### Features

- Full support for all Armada operations
- Event streaming and job watching
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Type hints for better IDE support

### Quick Start

```python
import grpc
from armada_client.client import ArmadaClient
from armada_client.k8s.io.api.core.v1 import generated_pb2 as core_v1

# Create client
channel = grpc.insecure_channel("localhost:50051")
client = ArmadaClient(channel)

# Submit a job
job = client.submit_jobs(
    queue="my-queue",
    job_set_id="my-job-set",
    job_request_items=[job_request]
)

# Watch job events
for event in client.get_job_events_stream(queue="my-queue", job_set_id="my-job-set"):
    print(event)
```

## .NET Client

The .NET client provides C# bindings for Armada. It supports .NET Standard 2.0 and can be built from source.

### Package Information

- **Package ID**: `ArmadaProject.Io.Client`
- **Target Framework**: .NET Standard 2.0

### Features

- Full gRPC API coverage
- Async/await support
- Strong typing with Protocol Buffers

## Java Client

The Java client provides JVM-based applications with access to Armada functionality.

### Requirements

- **Java 11** - Required Java version (required by Jenkins K8s plugin)
- **Maven 3.9.9** - Build tool

### Features

- Full gRPC support
- Compatible with Java 11+
- Works with JVM languages (Java, Kotlin, etc.)

### Building

Build from the root of the Armada repository:

```bash
mage BuildJava
```

## Scala Client

The Scala client is designed for Scala applications and is particularly useful for Spark integrations.

### Features

- Native Scala API
- Spark integration support
- Type-safe operations

### Building

Build from the root of the Armada repository:

```bash
# First, prepare proto files
mage BootstrapProto

# Then build Scala client
cd client/scala/armada-scala-client
mvn package
```

Or build in isolation from the repository root:

```bash
mage buildScala
```

## Go Client

The Go client is part of the Armada codebase and is used internally by `armadactl`. It can be imported as a Go package.

### Features

- Native Go implementation
- Used by armadactl CLI
- Full API coverage

### Usage

Import the client package in your Go code:

```go
import "github.com/armadaproject/armada/pkg/client"
```

## API Documentation

For comprehensive API documentation across all clients:

- [Python API Documentation](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/tree/master/client/python) - Python client source code and examples
- [Server API Documentation](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/tree/master/pkg/api) - REST and gRPC API reference

## Choosing a Client

- **Python**: Best for data science, ML workflows, and scripting
- **.NET**: Best for C# applications and .NET services
- **Java**: Best for Java applications and enterprise services
- **Scala**: Best for Scala applications and Spark workloads
- **Go**: Best for Go applications and contributing to Armada tooling
