## Introduction

This document is intended for developers who want to contribute to the project. It contains information about the
project structure, how to build the project, and how to run the tests.

## TLDR

Want to quickly get Armada running and test it? Install the [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites) and then run:

```bash
mage localdev minimal testsuite
```

To get the UI running, run:

```bash
mage ui
```

## Using Mage

Mage is a build tool that we use to build Armada. It is similar to Make, but written in Go. It is used to build Armada,
run tests, and run other useful commands. To see a list of available commands, run `mage -l`.

## LocalDev Setup

LocalDev provides a reliable and extendable way to install Armada as a developer. It runs the following steps:

- Bootstrap the required tools from [tools.yaml](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/blob/master/tools.yaml)
- Create a local Kubernetes cluster using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- Start the dependencies of Armada, including Pulsar, Redis, and Postgres.

**Note: If you edit a proto file, you will also need to run `mage proto` to regenerate the Go code.**

It has the following options to customize further steps:

- `mage localdev full` - Runs all components of Armada, including the Lookout UI.
- `mage localdev minimal` - Runs only the core components of Armada (such as the API server and an executor).
- `mage localdev no-build` - Skips the build step; set `ARMADA_IMAGE` and `ARMADA_TAG` to choose the Docker image to
  use.

`mage localdev minimal` is what is used to test the CI pipeline, and is the recommended way to test changes to the core
components of Armada.

## Identifying the Conflict

Before making any changes, it's essential to identify which port is causing the conflict. Port 6443 is a common source
of conflicts. You can check for existing bindings to this port using commands like `netstat` or `lsof`.

1. The `kind.yaml` file is where you define the configuration for your Kind clusters. To resolve port conflicts:

- Open your [kind.yaml](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/blob/master/e2e/setup/kind.yaml) file.

1. Locate the relevant section where the `hostPort` is set. It may look something like this:

   ```
   - containerPort: 6443 # control plane
     hostPort: 6443  # exposes control plane on localhost:6443
     protocol: TCP
   ```

   - Modify the hostPort value to a port that is not in use on your system. For example:

   ```
   - containerPort: 6443 # control plane
     hostPort: 6444  # exposes control plane on localhost:6444
     protocol: TCP
   ```

   You are not limited to using port 6444; you can choose any available port that doesn't conflict with other services
   on your system. Select a port that suits your system configuration.

### Testing if LocalDev is working

Running `mage testsuite` will run the full test suite against the localdev cluster. This is the recommended way to test
changes to the core components of Armada.

You can also run the same commands yourself:

```bash
go run cmd/armadactl/main.go create queue e2e-test-queue

# To allow Ingress tests to pass
export ARMADA_EXECUTOR_INGRESS_URL="http://localhost"
export ARMADA_EXECUTOR_INGRESS_PORT=5001

go run cmd/testsuite/main.go test --tests "testsuite/testcases/basic/*" --junit junit.xml
```

### Running the UI

In LocalDev, the UI is built seperately with `mage ui`. To access it, open http://localhost:8089 in your browser.

For more information see the [UI Developer Guide](./developer/ui.mdx).

### Choosing components to run

You can set the `ARMADA_COMPONENTS` environment variable to choose which components to run. It is a comma separated list
of components to run. For example, to run only the server and executor, you can run:

```bash
export ARMADA_COMPONENTS="server,executor"
```

### Running Pulsar backed scheduler with LocalDev

Ensure your local environment is completely torn down with

```bash
mage LocalDevStop
```

And then run

```bash
mage LocalDev minimal
```

Ensure your local dev environment is completely torn down when switching between pulsar backed and legacy
setups.

If the eventsingester or the scheduleringester don't come up then just manually spin them up with `docker-compose up`.

## Debugging

The mage target `mage debug` supports multiple methods for debugging, and runs the appropriate parts of localdev as
required.

**NOTE: We are actively accepting contributions for more debugging guides!**

It supports the following commands:

- `mage debug vscode` - Runs the server and executor in debug mode, and provides a launch.json file for VSCode.
- `mage debug delve` - Runs the server and executor in debug mode, and starts the Delve debugger.

### VSCode Debugging

After running `mage debug vscode`, you can attach to the running processes using VSCode.
The launch.json file can be found [Here](../../developer/debug/launch.json)

For using VSCode debugging, see the [VSCode Debugging Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).

### Delve Debugging

The delve target creates a new docker-compose file: `./docker-compose.dev.yaml` with the correct volumes, commands and
images for debugging.

If you would like to manually create the compose file and run it yourself, you can run the following commands:

```bash
mage createDelveCompose

# You can then start components manually
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d server executor
```

After running `mage debug delve`, you can attach to the running processes using Delve.

```bash
$ docker compose exec -it server bash
root@3b5e4089edbb:/app# dlv connect :4000
Type 'help' for list of commands.
(dlv) b (*SubmitServer).CreateQueue
Breakpoint 3 set at 0x1fb3800 for github.com/armadaproject/armada/internal/armada/server.(*SubmitServer).CreateQueue() ./internal/armada/server/submit.go:137

   135: }
   136:

   138:         err := checkPermission(server.permissions, ctx, permissions.CreateQueue)
   139:         var ep *ErrUnauthorized
   140:         if errors.As(err, &ep) {
   141:                 return nil, status.Errorf(codes.PermissionDenied, "[CreateQueue] error creating queue %s: %s", request.Name, ep)
   142:         } else if err != nil {
   143:                 return nil, status.Errorf(codes.Unavailable, "[CreateQueue] error checking permissions: %s", err)
   144:         }
   145:
(dlv)
```

All outputs of delve can be found in the `./delve` directory.

External Debug Port Mappings:

| Armada service    | Debug host     |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| server            | localhost:4000 |
| executor          | localhost:4001 |
| binoculars        | localhost:4002 |
| eventingester     | localhost:4003 |
| lookout           | localhost:4004 |
| lookoutv2         | localhost:4005 |
| lookoutingester   | localhost:4006 |
| lookoutingesterv2 | localhost:4007 |

## GoLand Run Configurations

We provide a number of run configurations within the `.run` directory of this project. These will be accessible when
opening the project in GoLand, allowing you to run Armada in both standard and debug mode.

The following high-level configurations are provided, each composed of sub-configurations:

1. `Armada Infrastructure Services`
   - Runs Infrastructure Services required to run Armada, irrespective of scheduler type
2. `Armada (Legacy Scheduler)`
   - Runs Armada with the Legacy Scheduler
3. `Armada (Pulsar Scheduler)`
   - Runs Armada with the Pulsar Scheduler (recommended)
4. `LookoutV2 UI`
   - Script which configures a local UI development setup

A minimal local Armada setup using these configurations would be `Armada Infrastructure Services` and one of (
`Armada (Legacy Scheduler)` or `Armada (Pulsar Scheduler)`). Running the `LookoutV2 UI` script on top of this
configuration would allow you to develop the Lookout UI live from GoLand, and see the changes visible in your browser. \*
\*These configurations (executor specifically) require a kubernetes config in `$PROJECT_DIR$/.kube/internal/config`\*\*

GoLand does not allow us to specify an ordering for services within docker compose configurations. As a result, some
database migration services may require rerunning.

### Other Debugging Methods

Run `mage debug local` to only spin up the dependencies of Armada, and then run the individual components yourself.

For required enviromental variables, please
see [The Enviromental Variables Guide](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/tree/master/developer/env/README.md).

## Finer-Grain Control

If you would like to run the individual mage targets yourself, you can do so.
See the [Manually Running LocalDev](./developer/manual-localdev.mdx) guide for more information.
