# Armada Quickstart

Easiest way to install Armada is by using the Armada Operator, which is a Kubernetes operator that manages the lifecycle of **Armada**.

Check out the [Armada Operator documentation](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada-operator) and follow the [Quickstart](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada-operator?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart) guide.
