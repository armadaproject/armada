name: Check required jobs

# This workflow is triggered when a workflow run for the CI is completed.
# It checks if the "All required checks done" job was actually successful
# (and not just skipped) and creates a check run if that is the case. The
# check run can be used to protect the main branch from being merged if the
# CI is not passing. We need to use a GitHub app token to create the check
# run because otherwise the check suite will be assigned to the first workflow
# run for the CI, which might not be the latest one. See
# https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/24616#discussioncomment-6088422
# for more details.
